    The Gameye Session API offers an agnostic way of hosting containerized game sessions without 
    having to worry about geographic capacity or scalability issues. The API offers a complete 
    suite of features to host a server based multiplayer game.

    # Authentication
    All endpoints of the Gameye Session API require authorization. This is done through
    Bearer Token Authentication. A bearer token is thus required in the header of each request.
    For example:

    ```Authorization: Bearer <token>```

        Streams the output that the game server writes to standard out-and standard err. Unlike 
        /query/log, this endpoint opens up a stream that can be invoked-and kept open until the
        underlying container of the game server has been terminated. It can therefore be used
        to provide secure and automated access to debug server related issues.

        There are two content types available:
          - text/plain
          - application/json

        The text/plain can be used for regular purposes e.g debugging your containerized application.
        The application/json content type on the other hand, is used for advanced use cases where it
        is necessary to distinguish between the different stream types.

  /query/log:
    get:
      operationId: log
      summary: Retrieves all logs from the container
      description: |
        Retrieves all of the logs of a session from its underlying container. Logs written to both
        STDOUT and STDERR will be returned. This endpoint can used to provide secure and automated 
        access to debug server application related issues.

        Please note that the logs are only available for retrieval after the session has been
        terminated and will be taken directly from the container itself.

        The logs of the container are available up until the container is removed from the 
        underlying machine. This means that your logs may or may not be available post-termination.

        Unlike the `/logs` endpoint, this endpoint does NOT continue to stream new logs from the
        container. Once all logs have been retrieved, the underlying connection is closed.
